## About

As part of the course INFO 4320, I worked with two others to build a Kinetic Sand Garden Table in Spring 2023. The table uses a magnet under the surface to guide a magnetic ball around in the sand in order to create intricate designs. It was inspired by the [Sisyphus Table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGynRqnkYXw) created by Sisyphus Industries.

For my part, I designed, CAD-modeled, 3D-printed, laser-cut, and assembled the entire "lower radial system". Essentially, the system that sits underneath the table and moves the ball bearing. I also wired up the circuitry for the lower system and programmed all the design patterns in Python (specifically MicroPython). The code and design files for the table can be in this repo.
