## About

As part of the course INFO 4320, I worked with two others to build a Kinetic Sand Garden Table in Spring 2023. The table uses a magnet under the surface to guide a magnetic ball around in the sand in order to create intricate designs. It was inspired by the [Sisyphus Table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGynRqnkYXw) created by Sisyphus Industries.

For my part, I designed, CAD-modeled, 3D-printed, laser-cut, and assembled the entire "lower radial system". Essentially, the system that sits underneath the table and moves the ball bearing. I also wired up the circuitry for the lower system and programmed all the design patterns in Python. The code and design files for the table can be in this repo.
